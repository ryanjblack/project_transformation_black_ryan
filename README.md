README Initial Update

Issues Solved:

Encountered an issue with the cloned stylelintrc file on line 37:

The following rule seems to be depreciated with the latest versions of the stylelint package:

>    "rule-non-nested-empty-line-before": ["always", { "except": ["after-single-line-comment"] }],

Updating to the following rule instead removed errors:

>    "rule-empty-line-before": ["always", { "except": ["after-single-line-comment"] }],
